# Waveform Generator

The Waveform Generator is a Python-based graphical user interface (GUI) application that allows users to generate and visualize various types of waveforms. This tool provides flexibility in changing waveform types, amplitudes, and frequencies.

## Features

- **Waveform Selection**: Choose from a variety of waveform types, including:
  - Sine Wave
  - Cosine Wave
  - Triangle Wave
  - Square Wave

- **Amplitude Adjustment**: Modify the amplitude of the generated waveform to control its intensity.

- **Frequency Control**: Adjust the frequency of the waveform to set the oscillation speed.

- **Live Visualization**: Instantly see the generated waveform displayed in a graphical plot.

## Usage

1. **Select Waveform Type**: Choose the desired waveform type from the available options.

2. **Amplitude Adjustment**:
   - Enter the desired amplitude value in the "Amplitude" input field.
   - Press Enter or click outside the input field to apply the new amplitude.

3. **Frequency Control**:
   - Use the frequency slider to adjust the waveform's frequency.
   - The current frequency is displayed in real-time on the interface.

4. **Live Visualization**: The generated waveform is displayed in a real-time plot within the application window.
